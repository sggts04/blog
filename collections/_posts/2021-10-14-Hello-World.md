The start of my blog, first post of many to come!

![](https://c.tenor.com/wHtFgOXljcUAAAAC/despicable-me-minions.gif)

Finally starting a blog! I've always wanted one, but never had the motivation to write. Now that I have some time on my hands, I feel it maybe the right time to start one. Expect this blog to be entirely about tech or career, this is not *My Diary* :), but I might sometimes decide to write about random stuff like Anime or Crypto.

This is gonna be it for this one, but expect a post very soon about my recent endeavours with Golang backend development!
