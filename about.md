I’m a student who is enthusiastic about technology and programming. I am currently studying Information Technology at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad. I grew up in Haridwar and did my schooling from Delhi Public School, Ranipur. I learned the basics of programming from school and then explored the Internet to expand my knowledge and understanding of various languages and concepts.

Other than that I’m a Sub-25 Speedcuber, Avid Gamer(mainly CS:GO & Valorant) and a FaZe Clan CS:GO Fan! A lot of my free time goes into coding, browsing Reddit, researching crypto or watching TV Shows.

With reference to programming, I’m experienced with HTML&CSS, Python, C++, JS/TS, Go, NodeJS, Git, SQL, Bash.
I love to explore and learn basics of new techologies be it Kubernetes and Docker or Smart Contracts on Ethereum.
I'm a frequent open-source contributor to many projects and I open-source my own projects aswell. My Github Profile is linked in the footer.

You can see my projects and their corresponding links on the Projects page below.
