I’m a student who is enthusiastic about technology and programming. I am currently interning as a Product Engineer at Sprinklr and studying Information Technology at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad. I grew up in Haridwar and did my schooling from Delhi Public School, Ranipur. I learned the basics of programming from school and then explored the Internet to expand my knowledge and understanding of various languages and concepts.

Other than that I’m a Sub-25 Speedcuber, Avid Gamer(favourites being CS:GO, Valorant, Minecraft) and a FaZe Clan CS:GO Fan! A lot of my free time goes into coding, browsing Reddit, running or watching anime.

With reference to programming, I’m experienced with NodeJS, Python, HTML&CSS, C++, Git, SQL, Bash. Also getting into Golang, Typescript and Java. I love to explore and learn basics of new techologies be it Kubernetes and Docker or Smart Contracts on Ethereum.

I'm a frequent open-source contributor to many projects and I open-source my own projects aswell. My Github Profile is linked in the footer.
