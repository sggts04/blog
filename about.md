I'm a backend developer currently working at Sprinklr. How do your calls to a company's customer care team route to the best support agent? I work on optimizing that. I'm super enthusiastic about technology and programming and finished my graduation in Information Technology from Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad. I grew up in Haridwar and did my schooling from Delhi Public School, Ranipur. I learned the basics of programming from school and then explored the Internet to expand my knowledge and understanding of various languages and concepts.

Other than that Iâ€™m a Chess addict, Avid Gamer(favourites being CS:GO, Minecraft, currently playing Elden Ring) and a space lover! A lot of my free time goes into coding, playing chess or games, or watching extremely random youtube videos.

With reference to programming, I currently work with Java (Spring Boot) and plenty of other technologies to support it like Mongo, Elastic Search, Redis or Kafka. I've also worked with NodeJS, Python, Javascript, C++ and SQL. I love to explore and learn basics of new techologies be it Kubernetes and Docker or Smart Contracts on Ethereum.
